      client ---------req--------> | server
             <---------res-------- |



==> Input from command Line
    1. To get the input from Command line <-- we can use "process" object in Node jS
    2. Create the file with Input 
    3. Delete the file with Input


==> Core Module in Node JS:
      1. What is core Module?
      2. What are global Module:
           Those module which we not import called global module Likeconsole.log()
                                    
      3. What are Non-global Module 
          Those module which we import or require() called Non-global module Like fs, os, path

      1. Make a server
      2. Create header and API body
      3. Create an API with static data
      4. put data into another file


===> Status code of HTTP:

       2. 201 <-- created, The request has been fulfilled and resulted 
                  in a new resource being created

        4. Reaname file
        5. Delete file


==> How Node JS Internally Work?
      1. Call Stack
      2. Node APIs 
      3. CallBack Queue
